This Project, Polymind is a networked webpage optimized for smartphones and Tablets.
It is a display that extends and helps to communicate. Originally designed for brainstorming, it should helps people talk about and explore all kinds of topics.
People are gathered around a central area - the main "pool"- defined by an IPad.
They can interact with this area through their own space which is defined by their phone. The idea is to initiate debates. 
Each participant is able to create and add thoughts to the main pool. The main pool gathers all the ideas, making them available to discuss and interact..
